/* tape.c â€” a command-line C program to simulate a Turing machine roughly as Turing proposed, with a 
 * device reading and writing from an indefinitely long length of tape. The tape consists in a series 
 * of binary digits which are read one at a time, and the machine is always in one of a finite 
 * number of internal states. The final component is a set of instructions built into the machine, 
 * which relate each pair of internal state and currently-read binary digit to a trio of 
 * operations; an internal state to change to, a binary digit to write to the current position, even 
 * if these are the same as the current internal state and the digit presently in that position; 
 * and a direction to move along the tape. The direction is either R, to move one digit to the right, 
 *, or L, and in addition it may command STOP to stop the machine.
 *
 * The machine starts at position 0 on the tape. At every step, the present internal state and bit
 * being read are printed, by default to stdout, along with the instruction to be executed. When the
 * machine reaches STOP, the program exits.
 *
 * Text files representing a length of tape and an instruction set respectively must be given
 * as command-line paramaters. Any changes made to the tape will be saved to the file; this won't 
 * necessarily all be at the STOP command, because the program only reads one buffer of tape at a 
 * time, and writes all changes to that buffer once a new section of tape is needed. The BUFFER_SIZE 
 * is 1024 by default, which is much smaller than modern computers demand, but low enough to 
 * demonstrate the principle of a buffer within the small scale on which we are working. The number 
 * of possible internal states is capped at 128 (as the internal state is represented by a non-negative)
 * signed byte), and the number of instructions is capped accordingly. Equally, one instruction for
 * every possible combination of internal state and bit currently read.
 *
 * Further details in README.md
